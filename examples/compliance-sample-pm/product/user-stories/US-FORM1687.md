### User Story

As a practice staff (MFA), I want form feature per contract, so that forms are generated correctly for submission.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a contract with form features, when the user opens form view, then only the contract's form set is shown

### Actual Acceptance Criteria

**Status: Implemented**

1. The `FormAPP.GetForms` endpoint filters forms by `contractId`, `oKV`, `ikNumber`, and `chargeSystemId` to return only the contract's form set
2. The `FormAPP.GetAllForms` endpoint provides the full form catalog for reference
