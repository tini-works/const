# hermes-bff
## Goal

Auto-generated TypeScript package (pvs-hermes) providing type-safe API clients, React hooks, and WebSocket handlers from Protocol Buffer definitions via GOFF code generation. Located in `pkgs/pvs-hermes/`.
## Container Connection

<!-- How does this component advance the parent container's Goal? -->
<!-- What would break in the container without this component? -->

<!--
COMPONENT CATEGORIES:

Foundation (01-09): Infrastructure choices that enable features.
  - Choice: What platform/technology/pattern was chosen
  - Provides: What capability it makes available to other components
  - Fulfills: Which container responsibility it satisfies

Feature (10+): Business capabilities built on foundations.
  - Focuses: What business concern this component addresses
  - Uses: Which foundation components it depends on
  - Follows: Which refs govern its behavior

WHY DOCUMENT:
- Enforce consistency (current and future work)
- Enforce quality (current and future work)
- Support auditing (verifiable, cross-referenceable)
- Be maintainable (worth the upkeep cost)

ANTI-GOALS:
- Over-documenting -> stale quickly, maintenance burden
- Text walls -> hard to review, hard to maintain
- Isolated content -> can't verify from multiple angles

PRINCIPLES:
- Diagrams over text. Always.
- Fewer meaningful sections > many shallow sections
- Add sections that elaborate the Goal - remove those that don't
- Cross-content integrity: same fact from different angles aids auditing

GUARDRAILS:
- Must have: Goal section
- Prefer: 2-4 focused sections
- Each section must serve the Goal - if not, delete
- If a section grows large, consider: diagram? split? ref-*?

REF HYGIENE (component level = component-specific concerns):
- Before writing: does a ref-* already cover this? Cite, don't duplicate.
- Each ref-* cited must directly serve the Goal - no tangential refs.
- If you're duplicating a ref, cite it instead.

Common sections (create whatever serves your Goal):
- Contract (Provides/Expects), Dependencies, Behavior, Edge Cases, Constraints

## Layer Constraints

This component operates within these boundaries:

**MUST:**
- Focus on single responsibility within its domain
- Cite refs for patterns instead of re-implementing
- Hand off cross-component concerns to container

**MUST NOT:**
- Import directly from other containers (use container linkages)
- Define system-wide configuration (context responsibility)
- Orchestrate multiple peer components (container responsibility)
- Redefine patterns that exist in refs
